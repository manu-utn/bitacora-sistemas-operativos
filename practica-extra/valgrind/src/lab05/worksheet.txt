Name:

Task 1
------

Compile and execute `memleak.c`. Verify the output and try and
understand the program.

1.  Run valgrind on the `memleak` program. How many bytes does it say
    have been definitely lost?




2.  On which lines does valgrind indicate memory leaks have occurred?





3.  Describe what causes each memory leak.





4.  Try and fix the memory leaks and verify your fix with valgrind.
    Describe how you fixed the memory leaks.





Task 2
------

Compile and execute the memviolation.c program.

1.  Describe the output and execution of the program.
    Does it seem to be consistent?




2.  Run the program under valgrind. Identify the line of code that is
    causing the memory violation and its input.




3.  Debug the memory violation and describe the programming bug.




4.  Fix the memory violation and verify your fix with valgrind.
